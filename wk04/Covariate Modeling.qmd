## Covariate modeling

-   When: Ideally after establishing the base model.
-   Why: Help us understand which patient- or drug-specific characteristics are important determinants of PK parameters.
    -   Mechanistic understanding:
        -   Impact of disease type on CL.
        -   Drug-drug interactions.
    -   Controlling PK variability:
        -   Dose selection for a special population (e.g., obese patients).
        -   Dosing interval adjustment for extended release formulation.
-   How: Specify a mathematical relationship between a PK parameter and covariates.
    -   Usually requires adding parameters (mostly THETAs) in the model.

## Continuous covariates

-   Example: Body weight (WT) on CL
    -   Linear:
        -   `CL=THETA(1)*(1+THETA(2)*(WT-70))`
    -   Piece-wise (hockey-stick) linear:
        -   `IF(WT.LE.50) CL=THETA(1)*(1+THETA(2)*(WT-70))`
        -   `IF(WT.GT.50) CL=THETA(1)*(1+THETA(3)*(WT-70))`
    -   Exponential:
        -   `CL=THETA(1)*EXP(THETA(2)*(WT-70))`
    -   Power:
        -   `CL=THETA(1)*(WT/70)**THETA(2)`
-   Centering: in all of the above case, when WT=70, model collapse to `CL=THETA(1)`
    -   Interpretation of `THETA(1)`: Typical CL for a subject with 70 kg body weight.
    -   If replacing 70 with 60, for example, the interpretation of `THETA(1)` changes to "typical CL for a subject with 60 kg body weight", with no impact on model fittings.

## Categorical covariates

-   Example: Sex (Male=1; Female=0)
    -   Linear:
        -   `CL=THETA(1)`
        -   `IF(SEX.EQ.1) CL=THETA(1)*(1+THETA(2))`

## Covariate modeling approaches

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Selection methods:

-   Use the observed data to identify covariates based on **statistical significance**

-   Examples:

    -   Step-wise covariate modeling (SCM), or similar methods (e.g., COSSAC, SAMBA, etc).

    -   Machine learning methods: LASSO, tree-based methods, etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Pre-defined methods:

-   Pre-define covariates of interest before looking at the data.

-   Adding covariate based on

    -   **Clinical relevance**: Adding a transporter effect on CL based on mechanistic understanding despite small effect size.

    -   **Regulartory interest**: Adding Asian population effect as covariate to support a PMDA submission.

-   Ignoring statistical significance during modeling.

-   Model inference relies on post-modeling simulations (e.g., forest plots).

-   Examples:

    -   Full-fixed effect modeling (FFEM)

    -   Full random effect modeling (FREM)

## Covariate modeling approaches

-   Active area of interest.
-   No single method is universally accepted as the "gold-standard".
-   Choice of method depends on modeling objectives and context (i.e., fit-for-purpose)

## Covariate examinations: **BEFORE** you start covariate modeling

-   Know you covariates
    -   Missing values?
        -   No missing values-Perfect!
        -   Small proportion (5%-10%):
            -   Impute with median/mode.
            -   Multiple imputation with chain equations (MICEs).
        -   Large proportion (e.g., 30%)
            -   Treat "missing" as a separate category.
    -   Range and distribution of continuous covariates (e.g., body weight).
        -   Distribution wide enough?
    -   Count in each category of categorical covariates (e.g., sex)
        -   Imbalance across category? Male:Female=20:1

## Data reduction: **BEFORE** you start covariate modeling

-   Examine covariate distributions for correlation/colinearity
    -   Select covariates carrying unique information (relatively independent).
    -   Rule of thumb: be cautious when $R^2>0.3$.
-   Exclude or combine covariates carrying repetitive information.
    -   WT, HT, BSA and BMI are highly correlated. If one included as a covariate, others may not need to be included.
    -   BLACK (No=0, Yes=1), WHITE (No=0, Yes=1) and ASIAN (No=0, Yes=1). May lump into one covariate (BLACK=1, WHITE=2, ASIAN=3, OTHER=4).

## Other consideration points

-   Was the study designed to estimate a covariate effect?
    -   SNP impact on CL.
-   Inclusion criteria of a clinical study may impact the choice of covariates.
    -   A study enroll only female patients (sex may be difficult to be explored as a covariate).
-   Prior knowledge (very subjective).
    -   Eye colors on CL?
-   Clinical interest of covariates

## Selection methods-(SCM)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](./pics/scm.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Forward selection (univariate)
    -   Base model -\> Add one covariate -\> Significantly better? -\> Yes, selected
    -   Base model -\> Add another covariate -\> Significantly better? -\> No, not selected
    -   ...
-   Backward Elimination
    -   Full model[^1] -\> remove one covariate -\> significantly worse?[^2] -\> Yes, selected
    -   Full model -\> remove another covariate -\> significantly worse? -\> No, not selected
    -   ...
-   How to test significance?
    -   Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) for **nesting** models
:::
:::

[^1]: Full model: the model include all covariates screened in univariate forward selection.

[^2]: P-values during BE are often stricter.

## Nesting example

-   Model 1:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)
```

-   Model 2:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)*(WT/70)**THETA(2)
```

-   If `WT/70` equals 1, then `(WT/70)**THETA(2)` equals 1, resulting in `TVCL = THETA(1)`.
-   So Model 1 is nested within Model 2.

## Another nesting example

-   Model 1:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)
```

-   Model 2:

``` bash
    TVCL = THETA(1)
    IF(SEX.EQ.0) TVCL = TVCL * THETA(2)
```

-   With `THETA(2)` fixed to 1.0 (it’s null value)
    -   `TVCL = THETA(1)` (if male)
    -   `TVCL = THETA(1)` \* 1 (if female)
-   No predictive difference between males and females when `THETA(2)` is set to its null value
-   Smaller model (without SEX) is nested

## Nesting?

-   Model 1:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)
```

-   Model 2:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)*WT
```

-   No biological meaningful WT reference value to remove the effect of WT.
-   Be careful. You can add COV effect without nesting.

## Statistical significance vs. clinical relevance

Example 1:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)
IF(SEX.EQ.0) TVCL = TVCL*THETA(2)
```

-   Fix `THETA(2)=1`, OFV=69.9
-   Estimate `THETA(2)`, `THETA(2)`estimated as 1.1, OFV=62.1
-   Clinical relevant?
    -   Females have a 10% faster CL than males
-   Statistical significant?
    -   dOFV=69.9-62.1=7.8
    -   Using a P value criteria (0.01) with 1 DF, if dOFV\>6.63, the COV is considered statistically significant.
-   Statistically significant $\neq$ clinically relevant
    -   Maybe you just happen to have a large sample size (n=3000).
    -   Any small difference between subgroups can be detected.
    -   Do we really care 10% faster CL clinically in females than males clinically.

## Statistical significance vs. clinical relevance

Example 2:

``` bash
TVCL = THETA(1)
IF(SEX.EQ.0) TVCL = TVCL*THETA(2)
```

-   Fix `THETA(2)=1`, OFV=21.3
-   Estimate `THETA(2)`, `THETA(2)`estimated as 0.4, OFV=20.1
-   Clinical relevant?
    -   Females have a 60% slower CL than males
-   Statistical significant?
    -   dOFV=21.3-20.1=1.2
    -   Using a P value criteria (0.01) with 1 DF, only if dOFV\>6.63, the COV is considered statistically significant.
-   Statistically insignificant $\neq$ clinically inrelevant
    -   Maybe your sample size is too small (n=8).
    -   Although COV effect is large (60%), the study is not sufficiently powered to detect it

## Pre-defined methods: FFEM

Full fixed-effect modeling (FFEM)[^3] procedure: 
-   Develop a stable base model. 
-   **Thoughful** consideration given to potential covariate-parameter relationships. 
-   Full covariate model is constructed and checked for goodness-of-fit. 
-   Check point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
    -   Unimportant covariates are driven to 0 during estimation with wide CIs. 
    -   If the inclusion of an unimportant covariate makes a model "unstable", consider exclude it from the model.
        -   Model cannot converge
        -   Covariance step fails
        -   Very wide and unacceptable CIs (e.g., 2000% relative standard error)
-   Make inference based on simulations using point estimates and 95% CIs.

## **Thoughful** considerations: 

incorporate covariate effects in the model based on[^3]: 

-   Scientific and clinical interest. 
-   Mechanistic plausibility. 
-   Prior knowledge of covariate effect (e.g., body size on CL).
-   Exploratory graphics (e.g., trend of parameter vs. covariate relationships)
-   Avoid simultaneous inclusion of correlated/collinear covariates.
